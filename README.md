The project Voice Command Based Object Detection is made to detect object in an image or in real-time using one‚Äôs webcam. This program works with both on the basis of voice assistance and with keyboard and cursor. 

While running the program in first page user will receive 3 buttons. 
The first Button having a shape of mic, ‚Äúüéô ‚Äù on left side of screen is to turn on voice-based command; where user can speak and give his command and even user will also receive feedback voice as whether your voice was clear and command was present. 

The second Button is named as Live object Detection which gets access to webcam and start recognizing the object found in webcam, recognized objects are surrounded by a boundary of random color with name of object on the top of boundary and speaking the name of object. 

The third Button is named as Image Based Object Detection which opens a new window so that user will give path of the image file if wrong path is found user will receive an error message. Later on, objects in this image are recognized and are named accordingly while speaking the name of objects captured in image. User must ensure that he should delete the file if not required or save in another folder if required. 

While using this program one must ensure good internet connection so that voice assistance to work accordingly. Whenever an object is found we receive a voice message as the name of object detected. 

 This project is developed so that few objects among a group of objects can be classified. This can even act in creating a motion sensor as by changing a few lines of code and saving still image‚Äôs matrix and comparing it with real time image.
